;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Calculate information about the current scope.
;;
;; Manages the current scope as a structure that can be cached on a
;; per-file basis and recycled between different occurances of
;; analysis on different parts of a file.
;;
;; Pattern for Scope Calculation
;;
;; Step 1: Calculate DataTypes in Scope:
;;
;; a) What is in scope via using statements or local namespaces
;; b) Lineage of current context.  Some names drawn from step 1.
;;
;; Step 2: Convert type names into lists of concrete tags
;;
;; a) Convert each datatype into the real datatype tag
;; b) Convert namespaces into the list of contents of the namespace.
;; c) Merge all existing scopes together into one search list.
;; 
;; Step 3: Local variables
;;
;; a) Local variables are in the master search list.
