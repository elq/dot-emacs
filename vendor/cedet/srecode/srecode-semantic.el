;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Semantic specific extensions to the Semantic Recoder.
;;
;; I realize it is the "Semantic Recoder", but most of srecode
;; is a template library and set of user interfaces unrelated to
;; semantic in the specific.
;;
;; This file defines the following:
;;   - :tag argument handling.
;;   - <more goes here>

;;; Code:
(require 'srecode-insert)
(require 'srecode-dictionary)
(require 'semantic-tag)
(require 'senator)

;;; Managing the `current' tag
;;
(defclass srecode-semantic-tag (srecode-dictionary-compound-value)
  ((prime :initarg :prime
	  :type semantic-tag
	  :documentation
	  "This is the primary insertion tag.")
   )
  "Wrap up a collection of semantic tag information.
This class will be used to derive dictionary values.")

(defvar srecode-semantic-selected-tag nil
  "The tag selected by a :tag template argument.
If this is nil, then `senator-tag-ring' is used.")

(defun srecode-semantic-tag-from-kill-ring ()
  "Create an `srecode-semantic-tag' from the senator kill ring."
  (if (ring-empty-p senator-tag-ring)
      (error "You must use `senator-copy-tag' to provide a tag to this template"))
  (let ((tag (ring-ref senator-tag-ring 0))
	)
    (srecode-semantic-tag (semantic-tag-name tag)
			  :prime tag)
    ))

;;; :tag ARGUMENT HANDLING
;;
;; When a :tag argument is required, identify the current :tag,
;; and apply it's parts into the dictionary.
;;;###autoload
(defun srecode-semantic-handle-:tag (dict)
  "Add macroes into the dictionary DICT based on the current :tag."
  ;; We have a tag, start adding "stuff" into the dictionary.

;;; :tagtype ARGUMENT HANDLING
;;
;; When a :tagtype argument is required, identify the current tag, of
;; cf class 'type.  Apply those parameters to the dictionary.
