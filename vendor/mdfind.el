;;; Commentary:

;; A quick and dirty major mode for displaying results of OS X's
;; `mdfind' command. Put this file in your load path and require
;; `mdfind': an interactive function of the same name will be
;; available. When invoked, it will ask you for a directory and a
;; query string that will be passed to the OS X mfind command. The
;; results of the query are then displayed on a special, read-only
;; buffer, whose mode derives from `org-mode' (so that links to files
;; are nicely displayed and clickable). In that buffer the following
;; key shortcuts are available:
;;   - n : go to next link
;;   - p : go to previous link
;;   - RET, o : follow link
;;   - q : bury buffer
;;   - m : perform new query

;; The latest version of this file is available at
;; http://hacks-galore.org/darcs?r=mdfind-el;a=tree
